                <h3>Completing the Project</h3>
                <p>
                    This project brought together everything I learned this semester, and I think it was a great way to show my progress from where I started.
                    The biggest challange I had when completing this project was creating a consistent and appealing design on all pages.
                    I changed the CSS and had to restructure the contents of my site multiple times to ensure I presented the information effectively.
                    Another challenge I had was creating the porfolio for all my labs, as I had to go back and re-evaluate and gather the data of each lab to showcase.
                    However, nothing was too difficult because it was mostly concepts we have learned already, so I just had to apply them, but it was very time consuming.
                    All in all, I am proud of the website I designed in terms of its old school aesthetics, organizational structure, and overall accessibility.

                <h3>Testing Observations</h3>
                <p>
                    Testing my website on different browsers and devices showed me how important it is to check for problems.
                    Firstly, on mobile devices, I noticed there were sizing and position errors with my headers and navigational links.
                    I also saw issues in mobile view with my images, being too big or too small and also having incorrect spacing.
                    When viewing my site in other browsers there were very little, if any, errors.
                    To fix these problems, I set appropriate margins, padding, and media queries for everything, and then set consistent widths for images in the mobile site.
                    A practice that helps with this process is tesing and debugging my site regularly as I develop it, which aids in catching errors early instead of waiting until the end.
                    This testing ensured my website would work and look good for everyone, no matter what device they used, and is polished for error.

                <h3>What I Learned in the Course</h3>
                <p>
                    This course taught me how to build very solid websites from scratch and has shown me what it is like to be a web developer.
                    I learned how to use HTML to structure and organize my web pages, setting the framework for good accessibility and design.
                    CSS helped me understand how to style pages to make them aesthetically pleasing and have this style adapt to different devices. 
                    Each lab helped me practice and get better at new skills, like using different languages and visual formats, testing designs, 
                    enhancing page layout, or even creating more complex and interactive websites. Nearing the end of this course, I feel more confident in creating simple, 
                    but well-designed websites that use the web standards we learned to present information in a way that is most effective and understandable for the end user.</p>
