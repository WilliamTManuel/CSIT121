        <p>This is the first web page I have fully created myself. 
            As a beginner coder, web pages are not an incredibly simple task.
            There are many steps and orders of tags I need to keep track of; it is a new language after all.
            However, after learning about the various terms and structures that make up HTML,
            I have become more comfortable in the medium and learned a great deal of new things.</p>

            <h3>Things I Learned</h3>
            <ol>                    
                <li>I learned how to organize my course work by creating dedicated folders
                    and having folder hierarchies to locate my files easier.</li>
                <li>I learned about the web standards and protocols that make up the Internet and the Web,
                    allowing them to function, especially for its end-users.</li>
                <li>I learned about HTML and what it is, how to create and edit HTML with tags to display different things,
                    and how to officially publish my HTML web pages.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There was a lot of coding vocabulary I was unsure of when creating a web page.
                I also needed a way to verify my code did not have any errors and was valid to publish.
                To learn more about the many HTML terms and how to validate my HTML, I used these websites to help me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">HTML Basics</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload">Markup Validator</a></li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Lab 2 Reflection</h3>
        <p>In Lab 2, I learned about the basics of HTML, including the basic structure of HTML,
            and I was able to apply this to create the foundation of my web page. 
            Assisting this were tags, which were helpful tools that defined the layout and organization within my website.
            I was unsure of what most of these even meant at the start, but they are what make up HTML as a markup language.
            The validator also helped me correct some of the missed tag information that would've caused error when I was coding, 
            which made me realize how important communicating correctly is when working with these languages.
            The course readings and videos in this module helped me undertsand a lot of these element and semantic rules and relationships, however.
            Now, I can confidently write a simple web page, being able to tell the web page what I want it to do.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Lab 3 Reflection</h3>
        <p>Expanding on the previous lab, Lab 3 taught me how to add styles to the document to make it look like
            the aesthetic websites I see every day on the internet.
            This is possible thanks to the CSS language that accompanies HTML code, 
            as I was able to apply the basic CSS style structure using internal and external methods that serve to reduce the clutter in my HTML.
            After I understood the structure, I could start designing parts of the website using
            selectors, properties, and values. These were relatively simple and allowed me to assign various fonts,
            backgrounds, colors, and much more to the plain HTML text. However, I realized that it is the specifics that make CSS so useful,
            being able to modify everything very precisely as long as you can follow its structural rules properly.
            All in all, on top of writing a web page, I can now tell it how I want it to look.</p>
