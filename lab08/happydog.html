            <h2>Media Description</h2>
            <p>This is an picture of a smiling, joyful looking dog. They appear to be having a fun photoshoot in an urban area.</p>

            <h2>File Type Information</h2>
            <p>This type of file is called a JPEG or JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) and is expressed as .jpeg or .jpg at the end of files.<br>
                This is one of the most common types of files for images,<br> and it works the best for photographs due to its high quality and extremely wide range of colors.<br>
                It is also a raster file format made of tiny pixels that can create high resolutions.
            </p>

            <h2>Why I Chose This Image</h2>
            <p>I chose this image because I thought the dog looked very happy and positive, so by sharing it,<br>
                I hoped others could feel same as this good boy as well; I try to strive for this happiness in my everyday life.<br>
                Also, if I had a dog it would probably be of a similar breed, golden retrievers just look so cuddly.
