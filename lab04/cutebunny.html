            <h2>Media Description</h2>
            <p>This is an image of an adorable bunny with soft black fur and big floppy ears, just sitting down and chilling.</p>

            <h2>File Type Information</h2>
            <p>This type of file is called WebP (Web Picture) and it is expressed as .webp at the end of file names.<br>
                This is a more modern format that supports lossy and lossless compression, images, animations, and transparency.<br>
                It is also a raster file, but its main role is to make images smaller so they can load faster on the web.
            </p>

            <h2>Why I Chose This Image</h2>
            <p>I chose this image because I have relatives that own bunnys, and every time I get to see them they are most cuddly little animals.<br>
                I also admire how relaxed the bunny is and think more people should be like this.<br>
                Doing so would make our lives a lot less stressful and we would be able to enjoy life more.
