            <h2>Media Description</h2>
            <p>This is an animation of two cats just being silly and playing with each other.<br> 
                It is repeating because of the media format.</p>

            <h2>File Type Information</h2>
            <p>This type of file is called a GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) and its extension is expressed as .gif at the end of file names.<br>
                They are a raster file format that combines a sequence of digital images to create short animations.
            </p>

            <h2>Why I Chose This Image</h2>
            <p>I chose this image because I thought it was funny and that others may enjoy it too.<br>
                I also own two cats, so I relate with their random, playful nature a lot.
