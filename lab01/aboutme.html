            <p>
                Hello! My name is William Manuel and this my first time doing something in HTML. 
                I am very inexperienced when it comes to coding, but I am eager and excited to learn more about the medium this semester.
                I like to think I am a creative person, so I hope I can create some cool web pages and whatnot throughout my time in the course.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                
             Currently, I am studying in the field of CSIT to learn more about various technological fields.
             In doing so, I believe I will get a better idea about what career I may want to pursue in the future.
             Whatever job it may be, I hope I will enjoy it and my tech passions be fulfilled.

            <h2>Skills/Hobbies</h2>
            <p>

                I lack the critical-thinking and technological skills I desire right now, but I am a hard worker and seek to better my skillset through practical experience everyday.
                I have also always performed well academically, so I think this would aid me well in achieving my goals.
                Other than skills, my hobbies are video games, which inspired my love for tech, playing the guitar, as I love music, and hanging out with friends.
