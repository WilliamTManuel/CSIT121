            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Geolocation is a way to find out where a device is located in the real world.
                It uses tools like GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell towers to figure out your position and share it with websites or apps. 
                This one powerful web standard of many allows developers to add location features on the sites we visit, creating a more accessible and overall better user experience. 
                By using this technology, we can connect websites, apps, and ourselves to places around world by using the data of our location.

            <h3>Operations & Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                Geolocation allows our devices, whether is be a smartphone or a computer, to determine where we are and send that information to others when needed. 
                When a website asks you for your location and you grant permission, it can access your location details, which are then collected by the browser.  
                This geolocating can provide very precise data with GPS or a general area based on Wi-Fi or cell signals.
                For these reasons, the main concern with geolocation is the vulnerability of ones privacy and potential security.
                Despite this, however, it is still an important tool that serves many different purposes on the web and changes various, significant aspects of peoples' lives.

            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>
                Geolocation is also simple for developers to use and works with just a few lines of code within HTML and JavaScript. 
                There are countless examples of its features, such as live location sharing, finding local services, or providing directions, that we use day-to-day. 
                Additionally, developers can make it work better and change its behavior by setting time limits, saving location details to use again later, or providing fixes for errors. 
                Due to its ease of use, versatility, and ability to enhance, geolocation has become a heavily sought out and key part of many modern websites and apps.
