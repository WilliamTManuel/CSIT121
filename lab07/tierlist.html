        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>This is a tier list that ranks the most popular gaming consoles in the last few decades, many of which I grew up with.
            Over the years, gaming consoles have brought me and many others lots of fun and a surplus of fond memories.
            As these consoles have evolved, so have people's preferences of what console is their favorite; but not by as much as you may think.
            By categorizing consoles into tiers, I wanted to highlight how technological performance or features is not the only thing that matters.
            Each console represents a unique chapter in gaming history and they have had a signficant cultural impact and legacy within the gaming community. 
            Some consoles, like the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2, have left a lasting influence on how games are developed and enjoyed today, 
            and many people find themselves returning to consoles from all eras like a time machine to re-live the past. 
            These experiences are why my favorite console is completely different to someone elses, 
            despite any objective flaws the console may have compared to others.
