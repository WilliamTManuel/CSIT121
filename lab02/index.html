        <p>This is the first web page I have fully created myself. 
            As a beginner coder, web pages are not an incredibly simple task.
            There are many steps and orders of tags I need to keep track of; it is a new language after all.
            However, after learning about the various terms and structures that make up HTML,
            I have become more comfortable in the medium and learned a great deal of new things.</p>

            <h3>Things I Learned</h3>
            <ol>                    
                <li>I learned how to organize my course work by creating dedicated folders
                    and having folder hierarchies to locate my files easier.</li>
                <li>I learned about the web standards and protocols that make up the Internet and the Web,
                    allowing them to function, especially for its end-users.</li>
                <li>I learned about HTML and what it is, how to create and edit HTML with tags to display different things,
                    and how to officially publish my HTML web pages.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There was a lot of coding vocabulary I was unsure of when creating a web page.
                I also needed a way to verify my code did not have any errors and was valid to publish.
                To learn more about the many HTML terms and how to validate my HTML, I used these websites to help me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">HTML Basics</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload">Markup Validator</a></li>
            </ul>
